# Microsoft Fabric Real-Time Analytics Workshop

Welcome to the Microsoft Fabric Real-time Analytics end-to-end workshop!

Analytics on real-time data presents unique challenges compared to traditional batch and near real-time scenarios. With real-time analytics, potentially large volumes of data need continuous ingestion, transformation, and visualization. 

In Microsoft Fabric, Real-Time Analytics is a fully managed big data analytics platform optimized for streaming, and time-series data. It utilizes a query language and engine with exceptional performance for searching structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data. Real-Time Analytics is fully integrated with the entire suite of Fabric products, for both data loading, data transformation, and advanced visualization scenarios.

An example of a real-time analytics architecture in Microsoft Fabric is illustrated below.

In this workshop, participants will get hands-on with a ficticious financial company "AbboCost." AbboCost would like to set up a stock monitoring platform to monitor price fluctuations and report on historical data. Throughout the workshop, we'll look at how every aspect of Microsoft Fabric can be incorporated as part of a larger solution -- by having everything in an integrated solution, we'll be able to quickly and securely integrate data, build reports, create data warehouses and lakehouses, forecast using ML models, and so on.
