Varies by module

## :loudspeaker: Introduction

This module is optional, and explores additional advanced topics related to the solution: more advanced KQL queries, dashboads, and troubleshooting concepts.

> :bulb: **About this section**
> As questions and suggestions are received on the content, we'll add modules here as needed. We'll try to balance the length of content in the core modules with these more advanced topics. Some concepts may not apply to all participants -- data engineers, data analysts, data scientists, BI developers may want to dive deeper into some topics. These added modules are designed to go deeper on select topics.

The modules contained within will explore certain aspects of the solution in more depth, and can be consumed as desired and in any order.
