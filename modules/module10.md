> :bulb: **About this section**
> Every workshop is a balance between solution complexity, authenticity, and the goal to cover specific concepts in a short period of time. Some concepts may not apply to all attendees -- data engineers, data analysts, data scientists, BI developers may find some topics unnecessary for their role. These added modules are designed to go deeper on select topics.

The submodules contained within will explore certain aspects of the solution in more depth, and can be consumed as desired.

## :books: Submodules

* 10a: [KQL Queryset Improvements](../modules/module10a.md)

* 10c: [Predicition vs Actual Reporting](../modules/module10c.md)

## :tada: Summary
